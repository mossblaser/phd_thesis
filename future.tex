\chapter{Future research}
	
	In this thesis I have presented a number of new techniques which have made it
	possible to assemble and operate the SpiNNaker super computer. This work
	opens up a range of possibie lines of research to extend this work to future
	architectures and applications. In this chapter I focus on two anticipated
	challenges of future systems: growing scale and greater dynamicism in
	applications.

		\subsection{Grid machine room layouts}
			
			In chapter XXX, I developed a machine room layout for hexagonal torus
			topologies which allowed machines occupying a row of standard
			machine-room cabinets to scale up without the need for long
			interconnecting cables. For larger installations, however, it will be
			necessary to employ multiple rows of cabinets in a 2D arrangement.
