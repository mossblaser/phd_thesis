% Reverses the usual LaTeX margins, placing the wider margin on the left on

% larger margin will be on the binding side. Though this goes against
% typographical conventions, it is what the University requires.
%
% When professionally printing and binding a book, extra-wide paper is used and
% an extra space is left to allow for binding. Since theses usually aren't
% professionally printed and bound (but rather done by a hack-job at a
% university print shop), normal A4 paper is used and the extra space to allow
% for binding must be included as part of the margins.
