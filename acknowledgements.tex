	It is often said that it is not \emph{what} you know but \emph{who} you know.
	Throughout the course of my PhD I've been exceptionally lucky to have been
	helped along by a great number of people.
	
	Both my supervisor, Jim Garside, and co-supervisor, Steve Furber, have each
	spent countless hours patiently discussing and describing all manner of
	things to me while giving me great freedom in my project. Jim's office door
	has always been open to my unexpected interruptions, be it about work,
	writing or walking.  Likewise, Steve has always managed to find time for both
	technical and frivolous endeavours alike. I'm also hugely grateful to Luis
	Plana and Steve Temple who have been rich sources of sage advice, insightful
	questions and both have patiently suffered many of my foolish queries.
	
	Various parts of the work in this thesis (and numerous side projects) would
	not have been possible if not for a multitude of discussions and
	collaborations with Javier Navaridas, Simon Davidson and Dave Clark. I'm also
	indebted to Andrew Mundy and Jamie Knight, both of whom have donated so much
	time and effort towards verifying and using software implementations of the
	ideas in this thesis.
	
	The injection of lunchtime silliness by Andrew and Jamie, along with Andrew
	Webb, Amanieu d'Antras and other CDT members always brightened my day.
	Thanks too to the many students and staff of the School of Computer Sciences
	who have all helped fill the last few years with fun. Of course, I am also
	very grateful for the funding the School has provided for my research.
	
	I cannot thank my wonderful wife, Ann-Marie, enough for being by my side. She
	has given me so much support, love and kindness and endured a lifetime's
	quota of conversations about hexagons. Finally, the rest of my family deserve
	enormous gratitude for all their encouragement, especially my parents who are
	to blame for starting me down this path.
