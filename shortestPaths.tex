	% XXX: Add note explaining shortest path between two points in non-torus
	% space.
	
	In the previous chapter we explored the practical challenges of building
	machines which use hexagonal torus topologies working at the scale of units
	containing several nodes. To exploit these machines, however, we must also be
	able to route packets efficiently through the nodes in the resulting network.
	This chapter tackles the problem of finding shortest path vectors in
	hexagonal torus topologies. Shortest path vectors are used by many routing
	algorithms as the basis for route generation. In non-hexagonal torus
	topologies, finding shortest path vectors is trivial and intuitive but in
	hexagonal toruses, this is not the case.  In this chapter I introduce the
	Irregular Quadrant (IQ) method, a new technique for computing shortest path
	vectors in hexagonal torus topologies.  This method is cheaper to compute and
	more general than pre-existing techniques, functioning correctly on hexagonal
	torus topologies of any aspect ratio.
	
	In some hexagonal torus topologies, many shortest path vectors may exist
	between a given pair of points. I propose a technique for discovering all
	possible shortest path vectors. Using these alternative shortest path
	vectors, routing algorithms may be able to produce routes which load a
	network more evenly.
	
	In this chapter, I assume an idealised hexagonal torus topology without
	faults or other irregularities. The challenge of handling these artefacts of
	real-world systems will be tackled in chapter~\ref{sec:routing}.
	
	\section{Shortest path vectors}
		
		Many popular routing algorithms for torus topologies, including all
		published algorithms designed for SpiNNaker~\cite{davies12,navaridas14},
		compute a shortest path vector between the endpoints of a route and use
		this to generate a path through the network. A shortest path vector between
		two nodes is a vector, $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3, \ldots)$, whose
		magnitude, $\| \mathbf{v} \| = \lvert v_1 \rvert + \lvert v_2 \rvert +
		\lvert v_3 \rvert + \cdots$, is minimal with respect to all possible
		vectors between those nodes.

			{An example 2D mesh network with example shortest-path routes
			from `A' to `B' and `B' to `C'.}
			\label{fig:mesh-topology-coordinates}
		\end{figure}
		
		In a non-hexagonal mesh topology, shortest path vectors are computed by
		taking the element-wise difference between the source and destination
		nodes' coordinates. For example, figure~\ref{fig:mesh-topology-coordinates}
		shows a 2D mesh topology with three nodes labelled `A', `B' and `C' with
		position vectors $(1, 2)$, $(4, 5)$ and $(6, 1)$ respectively. The shortest
		path vector from node `A' to `B' is $(4, 5) - (1, 2) = (3, 3)$ and from `B'
		to `C' is $(6, 1) - (4, 5) = (2, -4)$. A route may be produced by advancing
		the number of hops specified for each dimension in the shortest path
		vector. For example, a route from `A' to `B' may be constructed from any
		permutation of the hops X$^+\,$X$^+\,$X$^+\,$Y$^+\,$Y$^+\,$Y$^+$, an
		example of which is included in the figure. Likewise routes from `B' to `C'
		may be constructed from permutations of the hops
		X$^+\,$X$^+\,$Y$^-\,$Y$^-\,$Y$^-\,$Y$^-$. Regardless of the order of the
		hops, the length of the route, $\mathbf{v}$, is given by the magnitude of
		the shortest path vector, $\|\mathbf{v}\|$.
		
		Many popular routing algorithms such as dimension order routing, right-turn
		only routing and longest dimension first routing~\cite{davies12} are simply
		defined as rules for ordering the hops specified by a shortest path vector.

			Computing shortest path vectors in non-hexagonal torus topologies is also
			straightforward. For example, to find the shortest path vector from node
			`A' to `B' in the 2D torus topology shown in figure~\ref{fig:torus-shortest-path-example} both nodes are translated such that
			the source node, `A', is at the centre of the network. The shortest path
			vector is then computed in the same way as a mesh network (figure~\ref{fig:torus-shortest-path-translate}). Note that, as in this example,
			translation may cause the destination node to `wrap around' the network.
			As illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:torus-shortest-path-routed}, the
			computed shortest path vector is also valid for the two points prior to
			translation.

			\end{figure}
			
			This procedure works because vectors from the centre of a non-hexagonal
			torus topology to any other point are identical to those in a
			corresponding mesh topology. For example, in figures
			\ref{fig:distance-map-mesh} and~\ref{fig:distance-map-torus} we can see
			that the magnitude of the shortest path vectors from the centre of a mesh
			and torus grow identically. Conversely, the magnitudes of vectors from
			other locations in mesh and torus topologies do not match.
		
	\section{Related work}
		
		The problem of finding shortest path vectors in hexagonal mesh topologies
		has been widely considered and formulations may be found in a variety of
		applications, including computer games~\cite{patel15}. Hexagonal toruses,
		by contrast, have only received limited attention. In this section I
		briefly summarise the solutions proposed for hexagonal mesh topologies
		before more deeply examining existing solutions for hexagonal torus
		topologies.
		
		\subsection{Hexagonal mesh networks}
			
			\begin{figure}
				\center
				\buildfig{figures/hex-mesh-topology-coordinates.tex}
				\caption{An example hexagonal mesh network topology.}
				\label{fig:hex-mesh-topology-coordinates}
			\end{figure}
			
			In hexagonal mesh topologies it is conventional to define three `axes' X,
			Y and Z as shown in
			figure~\ref{fig:hex-mesh-topology-coordinates}~\cite{patel15}. In this
			example, the three labelled nodes `A', `B' and `C' may be given position
			vectors such as $(1, 1, 0)$, $(3, 2, 0)$ and $(0, 0, -7)$ respectively.
			As in other mesh networks, a vector between two nodes is found by
			subtracting the nodes' vectors. For example, a vector from `A' to `B' is
			$(3, 2, 0) - (1, 1, 0) = (2, 1, 0)$. This vector can then be converted
			into a route in the same way as a mesh network by taking any permutation
			of the three hops  X$^+\,$X$^+\,$Y$^+$.
			
			As explained in detail in appendix~\ref{app:minimal-hex-coordinates},
			there are a multitude of vectors between any two points in a hexagonal
			mesh. For example, the vectors $(1, 0, -1)$ and $(3, 2, 1)$ also reach
			node `B' from `A'. However, for a given pair of nodes, there is always a
			single, unique vector whose magnitude is minimal which is given by the
			function:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\operatorname{minimiseVector}(x,y,z) =
					(x,y,z) - \operatorname{median}(x,y,z) \cdot (1,1,1)
			\end{equation*}
			%
			For example, the vector $(3, 2, 1)$ from `A' to `B' is minimised as
			follows:
			%
			\begin{align*}
				\operatorname{minimiseVector}(3,2,1) &=
					(3,2,1) - \operatorname{median}(3,2,1) \cdot (1,1,1) \\
				&=
					(3,2,1) - (2,2,2) \\
				&=
					(1,0,-1)
			\end{align*}
			%
			A side-effect of this is that a minimised vector will always contain at
			least one zero element, meaning that shortest path routes will use at most
			two of the three available dimensions.

			Unfortunately, the translation technique used for non-hexagonal toruses
			cannot be used in a hexagonal torus. As illustrated in figures
			\ref{fig:distance-map-hex-mesh} and \ref{fig:distance-map-hex-torus},
			shortest path vectors from the centre, or any other part of a hexagonal
			mesh network, do not grow in magnitude in the same way that those of a
			hexagonal torus network do. I am aware of two pre-existing approaches to
			computing shortest path vectors in hexagonal toruses. These are described
			below.
			
			\subsubsection{INSEE Method}
			
				The INSEE interconnect simulator has been used in all published
				research into SpiNNaker's hexagonal torus interconnect to
				date~\cite{navaridas09,ghasempour15}. Internally INSEE finds shortest
				path vectors by selecting the shortest of a set of twelve candidate
				vectors known to always contain a shortest path vector.

					\label{fig:insee-vector-candidates}
				\end{figure}
				
				The twelve vectors considered are illustrated in
				figure~\ref{fig:insee-vector-candidates} and are constructed as
				follows.  First a shortest path vector from the source to target node
				is constructed as if the network was a 2D mesh producing a vector
				$(\Delta_\textrm{X},\Delta_\textrm{Y})$. A second 2D vector,
				$(\Delta'_\textrm{X},\Delta'_\textrm{Y})$, is also defined:
				
				\noindent
				\begin{align*}
					\Delta'_\textrm{X} &= \Delta_\textrm{X} - \operatorname{sign}(\Delta_\textrm{X})W
					\\
					\Delta'_\textrm{Y} &= \Delta_\textrm{Y} - \operatorname{sign}(\Delta_\textrm{Y})H
				\end{align*}
				%
				Where $W$ and $H$ are the width and height of the network respectively.
				This vector describes a route from the source to destination node that
				\emph{always} wraps around the peripheries of both the `X' and `Y'
				dimensions.
				
				Two further 2D vectors, $(\Delta'_\textrm{X},\Delta_\textrm{Y})$ and
				$(\Delta_\textrm{X},\Delta'_\textrm{Y})$ may be defined which wrap around
				just the X or Y axis, respectively.
				
				Each of the four 2D vectors may be converted into three hexagonal 3D
				vectors in which one element of the vector is zero. In total this
				results in twelve different vectors which cover all combinations of
				wrapping and non-wrapping routes and all combinations of axes used. The
				vector with the smallest magnitude must be the shortest path vector.
				
				This method can find shortest path vectors in hexagonal torus
				topologies of any aspect ratio but, compared with the XYZ-protocol
				(described next), is relatively clumsy and slow to compute.
			
			\subsubsection{XYZ-Protocol}
			
				Hoffmann and D\'es\'erable described the XYZ-protocol for computing
				shortest path vectors in hexagonal toruses with equal width and
				height~\cite{hoffmann15,hoffmann11}.  First, the source and destination
				nodes are translated such that the source node lies at the centre of
				the topology. The authors observe that from the centre of the topology,
				the pattern with which distances grow differs between the four
				quadrants outlined in figure~\ref{fig:xyz-protocol-regions}.
				
				\begin{figure}
					\center
					\buildfig{figures/xyz-protocol-regions.tex}
					
					\caption{The four quadrants defined by the XYZ-protocol.}
					\label{fig:xyz-protocol-regions}
				\end{figure}
				
				If the destination lies in quadrants 1 or 4, a route may be constructed
				as if in a hexagonal mesh topology. If the destination lies in
				quadrants 2 or 3, however, the algorithm tests whether taking a
				mesh-like vector within the quadrant or wrapping-around either the X or
				Y dimensions yields the shortest vector.
				
				By comparison with the twelve vectors considered by the INSEE method,
				the XYP-protocol considers just one for destinations in quadrant 1 or 4
				and no more than three in quadrant 2 or 3. Though the XYZ-protocol can
				be computed more cheaply than the INSEE method, it does not produce
				valid shortest path vectors for hexagonal torus topologies with aspect
				ratios other than $1:1$.
		
	\section{The Irregular Quadrant (IQ) method}
		
		In this section I propose a new technique for finding shortest path vectors
		in hexagonal torus topologies called the Irregular Quadrant (IQ) method and
		compare its performance with existing techniques.
		
		\subsection{Computing shortest path vectors}
		
			Consider the problem of finding a shortest path vector from (0, 0, 0), at
			the bottom-left, to a node somewhere else in a hexagonal torus topology.
			
			\begin{figure}
				\center
				\buildfig{figures/shortest-path-regions.tex}
				
				\caption[The four irregular quadrants defined by the IQ method.]%
				{Hexagonal torus topologies of various aspect ratios divided into
				irregular quadrants in which a particular pair of dimensions are used.}
				\label{fig:shortest-path-regions}
			\end{figure}
			
			Figure~\ref{fig:shortest-path-regions} illustrates how hexagonal torus
			topologies of various aspect ratios may be partitioned into four
			\emph{irregular quadrants}. These quadrants are defined according to which
			axes are wrapped around by the shortest path vectors reaching them. The
			irregular quadrants correspond to locations reachable by shortest path
			vectors which:
			%
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Do not wrap
				\item Wrap around X only
				\item Wrap around Y only
				\item Wrap around both X and Y
			\end{enumerate}
			%
			Within each irregular quadrant, we observe that shortest path vectors are
			constrained to using only certain directions:
			%
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Only X$^+$, Y$^+$ and Z$^-$.
				\item Only X$^-$ and Y$^+$
				\item Only X$^+$ and Y$^-$
				\item Only X$^-$, Y$^-$ and Z$^+$.
			\end{enumerate}
			%
			Given the topology is of width $W$ and height $H$ and the
			destination node's 2D mesh coordinates are $(\Delta_\textrm{X},
			\Delta_\textrm{Y})$ we can define the shortest path vector within each
			irregular quadrant as:
			%
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item $\operatorname{minimiseVector}(\Delta_\textrm{X},\Delta_\textrm{Y},0)$
				\item $\operatorname{minimiseVector}(-(W-\Delta_\textrm{X}),\Delta_\textrm{Y},0)$
				\item $\operatorname{minimiseVector}(\Delta_\textrm{X},-(H-\Delta_\textrm{Y}),0)$
				\item $\operatorname{minimiseVector}(-(W-\Delta_\textrm{X}),-(H-\Delta_\textrm{Y}),0)$
			\end{enumerate}
			%
			Since we know that $0 \le \Delta_\textrm{X} < W$ and $0 \le
			\Delta_\textrm{Y} < H$, we can simplify the expressions for the magnitude
			of each of the above vectors. This yields four expressions giving the
			magnitude of a minimal vector as if in each irregular quadrant:
			%
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item $\operatorname{max}(\Delta_\textrm{X}, \Delta_\textrm{Y})$
				\item $(W - \Delta_\textrm{X}) + \Delta_\textrm{Y}$
				\item $\Delta_\textrm{X} + (H - \Delta_\textrm{Y})$
				\item $\operatorname{max}(W-\Delta_\textrm{X}, H-\Delta_\textrm{Y})$
			\end{enumerate}
			%
			From these expressions we can determine which irregular quadrant the
			destination is in by finding the expression with the minimum value. With
			this information, the shortest path can be found by minimising the vector
			associated with that irregular quadrant.  Figure~\ref{fig:iqmethod.py}
			shows a simple Python implementation of the IQ method.
			
			\begin{figure}
				\inputminted{python}{figures/iqmethod.py}
				
				\caption{A Python implementation of the IQ Method.}
				\label{fig:iqmethod.py}
			\end{figure}
			
			Compared with the INSEE method, this technique requires fewer cases to be
			considered (four rather than twelve) making it cheaper to compute.
			
			Unlike the four quadrants defined by the XYZ-protocol, the irregular
			quadrants defined by the IQ method correspond exactly to a particular
			shortest path vector. This means that, once the irregular quadrant a
			point lies in has been discovered, the shortest path vector can be
			calculated directly without considering multiple options. Though the
			boundaries between the four irregular quadrants are more complex than the
			quadrants of the XYZ-protocol, it is only marginally more expensive to
			discover which irregular quadrant a point lies in. In addition, the
			irregular quadrants retain their meaning across different aspect ratios
			making the IQ method suitable for any hexagonal torus topology.
		
		\subsection{Computing distances}
		
			The four vector magnitude expressions defined by the IQ method can also
			be combined to produce a compact expression of the distance between two
			points in a hexagonal torus topology:
			%
			\begin{align*}
				\|\operatorname{shortestPathVector}(\Delta_\textrm{X}, \Delta_\textrm{Y}, W, H)\| =
				\operatorname{min}(&\operatorname{max}(\Delta_\textrm{X}, \Delta_\textrm{Y}),\\
				                   &(W - \Delta_\textrm{X}) + \Delta_\textrm{Y},\\
				                   &\Delta_\textrm{X} + (H - \Delta_\textrm{Y}),\\
				                   &\operatorname{max}(W-\Delta_\textrm{X}, H-\Delta_\textrm{Y}))
			\end{align*}
			%
			This expression has also been derived independently from a
			graph-theoretic study of Cayley graphs, of which the hexagonal torus
			topology is a special case, by Xiao and Parhami~\cite{xiao04}.
		
		\subsection{Computational efficiency}
			
			Since computing shortest path vectors forms an integral part of the
			kernel of many routing algorithms, the running time of the function
			chosen can be an important consideration.
			
			To compare the performance of the three shortest path vector functions
			presented, the execution time of a C implementation of each technique was
			measured. The C implementation of the INSEE method is taken directly from
			the INSEE source code~\cite{navaridas09}. The C implementation of the
			XYZ-Protocol is a straight translation of the published
			pseudocode~\cite{hoffmann15}.
			
			Each function was called approximately 3 billion times: once for every
			pair of source and destination nodes in a $240\times240$ node hexagonal
			torus topology. The total execution time is then divided by the number of
			calls giving an average execution time.  This experiment was repeated 50
			times and the overall average execution time of each shortest path vector
			function was recorded. The experiments were conducted on a cluster of
			idle workstations with 3.10~GHz Intel Core-i5-2400 CPUs. The function
			implementations were compiled with GCC 5.3.0 with optimisations enabled
			(\verb|-O2|).
			
			\begin{figure}
				\center
				\buildrplot{figures/shortest-path-vector-runtimes.R}
				
				\caption[Mean execution times of shortest path vector functions.]%
				{Mean execution time of each shortest path vector function. Error bars
				indicate the range of the mean execution times of the fifty
				3-billion-combination experiments.}
				\label{fig:shortest-path-vector-runtimes}
			\end{figure}
			
			Figure~\ref{fig:shortest-path-vector-runtimes} shows the execution times
			of each shortest path vector function. From these results we can see that
			the INSEE method is slower than the other techniques. Although the
			XYZ-protocol and IQ method have similar performance, because the IQ
			method works for any hexagonal torus topology it is the better candidate
			for use in new applications.
	
	\section{Generating all shortest path vectors}
			
			\begin{figure}
				\center
				\buildfig{figures/wrap-alternatives.tex}
				
				\caption{Two distinct shortest path vectors in a hexagonal torus.}
				\label{fig:wrap-alternatives}
			\end{figure}
			
			In odd-sized non-hexagonal and $1:1$ hexagonal torus topologies there is
			exactly one distinct shortest path vector between any two points (though
			many routes may be defined from it). In even-sized topologies there may
			be two distinct shortest path vectors between nodes exactly half the
			length of an axis away as in figure~\ref{fig:wrap-alternatives}. The
			INSEE and IQ methods may generate either vector depending on how ties are
			broken in their implementation.
			
			\begin{figure}
				\center
				\buildfig{figures/spiralling.tex}
				
				\caption[Distinct shortest path vectors in non-square toruses.]%
				{Distinct shortest path vectors between two points, all with
				magnitude 11.}
				\label{fig:spiralling}
			\end{figure}
			
			Unlike non-hexagonal topologies, when the aspect ratio of a hexagonal
			topology is not $1:1$, some points may have many distinct (but equal
			magnitude) shortest path vectors.  For example,
			figure~\ref{fig:spiralling} illustrates three distinct shortest path
			vectors between an example pair of nodes. None of the shortest path vector
			functions discussed will generate all possible vectors in this situation,
			potentially limiting the choices available to routing algorithms.  To
			address this shortcoming, I propose a formula which enumerates every
			shortest path vector between a pair of points in a hexagonal torus.
			
			In a $W \times H$ hexagonal torus topology, starting from any node the
			vector $(0, H, 0)$ straightforwardly wraps once around the Y axis
			arriving back at the node it started from. The vector $(1,1,1)$ also
			returns to its starting point as described in
			appendix~\ref{app:minimal-hex-coordinates}. As a consequence $(0,H,0) -
			H\cdot(1,1,1) = (-H, 0, -H)$ must also be a vector which leads back to
			where it started. Adding this vector to a shortest path vector of the
			form $(x, 0, z)$ results in a new shortest path vector if $x\ge H$ and
			$z\le0$.
			
			For example, the vector $(10, 0, -1)$ (magnitude 11) in
			figure~\ref{fig:spiralling} can be added with $(-4, 0, -4)$ yielding $(6,
			0, -5)$ (also magnitude 11) which is still a shortest path vector between
			the two labelled nodes.  Since $(6, 0, -5)$ still meets the criteria
			defined above ($6 \ge 4$ and $-5 \le 0$), we can add $(-4, 0, -4)$ again
			yielding another shortest path vector $(2, 0, -9)$.  This new vector does
			not meet the requirement that $x \ge H$ (since $2 \ngeq 4$) and so no
			further shortest path vectors can be produced.
			
			More formally, a shortest path vector $(x, 0, z)$ may be converted into
			another shortest path vector $(x', 0, z')$ using the following formula:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				(x', 0, z') = (x, 0, z) - \left(\operatorname{trunc}\left(\frac{z}{H}\right) + n\right)(H, 0, H)
			\end{equation*}
			%
			where
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\left\{
					n \in \mathbb{Z}
				\;\Big|\;
					0 \le n \le
						\left\lfloor
							\frac{\left|x\right| + \left|z\right|}{H}
						\right\rfloor
				\right\}
			\end{equation*}
			%
			and $\operatorname{trunc}(\,\cdots)$ is the truncation operator which
			rounds towards zero to the nearest integer.
			
			A complementary formula may be derived based on the related observation
			that the vector $(W, 0, 0)$ results in no movement:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				(0, y', z') = (0, y, z) - \left(\operatorname{trunc}\left(\frac{z}{W}\right) + n\right)(0, W, W)
			\end{equation*}
			%
			where
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\left\{

	\section{Conclusions}
		
		The calculation of shortest path vectors in mesh and torus topologies is at
		the heart of many routing algorithms. In this chapter, I introduced a new
		technique for computing shortest path vectors in hexagonal toruses which
		generalises to any hexagonal torus topology while executing more quickly
		than existing approaches. In addition, I described a formula for
		enumerating the distinct shortest path vectors between points in hexagonal
		torus topologies. Unlike previous work, this allows routing algorithms
		greater freedom by providing a choice of shortest path vectors between some
		points.  These contributions demonstrate that key operations such as
		computing distances and shortest path vectors in hexagonal toruses can be
		efficient and exhaustive just as in non-hexagonal torus topologies.
