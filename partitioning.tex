\chapter{Partitioning hexagonal toruses}
	
	\label{sec:partitioning}
	
	The nodes in supercomputer networks are usually relatively small, for example
	in SpiNNaker each node is a single chip. To allow several nodes to share
	resources such as power supplies and to simplify construction, tens of nodes
	are typically packed together into a single unit such as a circuit board or
	server blade~\cite{gilge14,ajima12}. In commercial supercomputers built on
	non-hexagonal torus topologies, units usually represent a hypercube partition
	of the overall topology as illustrated in figure
	\ref{fig:apdx-hypercube-partitioning}~\cite{chen11,ajima12}.
	
	
	The analogue of this scheme in a hexagonal torus topology is a parallelogram
	as illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:apdx-parallelogram-partitioning}.  Each
	partition connects to six neighbouring partitions and, unlike hypercube
	partitions, the number of connections to each is imbalanced.  Specifically
	the partitions above-right and below-left are connected by only one link each
	while others are connected by many. As a consequence, multiple interconnect
	technologies may be needed if connections between partitions are concentrated
	into single cables as in SpiNNaker (see chapter~\ref{sec:background}).  This
	adds both to design complexity and system cost.

	In this appendix, I describe how, and why, the `wrapped triple' partitioning
	scheme devised by Davidson for SpiNNaker works~\cite{davidsonWiring}.
	
	\section{Tiling}
		
		For a particular configuration of nodes to form a valid partition, it must
		be possible to use this configuration to `tile' a hexagonal torus. In this
		thesis, a `pointy-topped' hexagon is used to represent a chip in a
		hexagonal torus which is drawn (by convention) in a parallelogram-shaped
		arrangement.
		
		Any partition which shares the `translational symmetry' of a pointy-topped
		hexagon must also tile a hexagonal torus. For example, in
		figure~\ref{fig:tiling-a-torus} we can see that $2\times2$ parallelograms
		can tile a $9\times9$ hexagonal torus topology.  In
		figure~\ref{fig:parallelogram-tiling}, I demonstrate that this
		parallelogram partition shares its translational symmetry with a
		pointy-topped hexagon. In figure~\ref{fig:parallelogram-tiling}a, the
		$2\times2$ partition is shown with each node shaded differently and, in
		figure~\ref{fig:parallelogram-tiling}b, a pointy-topped hexagon is
		superimposed. By tiling several copies of the partition
		(figure~\ref{fig:parallelogram-tiling}c), we can see that the repeating
		pattern of the parallelograms matches that of the pointy-topped hexagons. I
		refer to this property as the parallelogram sharing the translational
		symmetry of a pointy-topped hexagon.

		\end{figure}
		
		Notice that the parallelogram partition can be redrawn so that parts
		protruding from the overlaid hexagon wrap around to fill the gaps on
		opposite sides producing a pointy-topped hexagon shaped tile as shown in
		figure~\ref{fig:parallelogram-tiling}d.
		
	
	\section{How \emph{not} to tile a hexagonal torus}
	
		An `obvious' partitioning scheme for a hexagonal topology, which evenly
		distributes links between six sides, is a hexagonal partition. Such a
		partition might na\"ively be formed by wrapping `layers' of hexagons around
		a central hexagon as illustrated in
		figure~\ref{fig:wrapped-hexagon-tiling}a.
		
		\begin{figure}
			\center
			\buildfig{figures/wrapped-hexagon-tiling.tex}
			
			\caption[A wraped hexagon does not tile a hexagonal torus.]%
			{Visual proof that a wrapped hexagon does not share translational
			symmetry with a pointy-topped hexagon.}
			\label{fig:wrapped-hexagon-tiling}
		\end{figure}
	
		While this type of partition exposes six equally-sized edges (satisfying
		the requirement that connections between partitions should have a balanced
		number of connections) this partition does not share translational symmetry
		with a pointy-topped hexagon. Figure~\ref{fig:wrapped-hexagon-tiling}b
		shows a best fitting pointy-topped hexagon superimposed on the partition.
		In figure~\ref{fig:wrapped-hexagon-tiling}c, we can see that when tiled,
		the partition leaves gaps between the superimposed pointy-topped hexagons
		indicating it does not share translational symmetry.
		
		Consequently, it is not possible to construct a hexagonal torus from
		partitions of this shape. As an aside, it \emph{is} possible to construct a
		H-torus topology~\cite{zhao08}, a related, but different, topology
		mentioned briefly in \S\ref{sec:hex-vs-h-torus}.
	
	\section{Triads of triples}
		
		A `triple' is a partition made up of three nodes arranged as in
		figure~\ref{fig:wrapped-triple-tiling}a. This partition's edges may be
		broken into six groups with an equal number of connections, meeting the
		requirements set out at the beginning of this appendix. A triple, however,
		does not share translational symmetry with a pointy-topped hexagon but
		\emph{does} share it with a `flat-topped' hexagon (the
		\SI{30}{\degree}-rotated cousin of the pointy-topped hexagon) as
		demonstrated in figures~\ref{fig:wrapped-triple-tiling}b and
		\ref{fig:wrapped-triple-tiling}c.
		
		\begin{figure}
			\center
			\buildfig{figures/wrapped-triple-tiling.tex}
			
			\caption[Triples share translational symmetry with flat-topped hexagons.]%
			{Visual proof that a triple of pointy-topped hexagons shares the same
			translational symmetry as a flat-topped hexagon.}
			\label{fig:wrapped-triple-tiling}
		\end{figure}
		
		Because a triple made up of pointy-topped hexagons shares translational
		symmetry with a flat-topped hexagon, a triple made up of flat-topped
		hexagons must also share translational symmetry with a pointy-topped
		hexagon (turn figure~\ref{fig:wrapped-triple-tiling} by \SI{30}{\degree} to
		verify this).  Therefore, it follows that three triples arranged as in
		figure~\ref{fig:triad-tiling} -- a `triad' -- share translational symmetry
		with pointy-topped hexagons.  Consequently, triads of triples may be used
		to tile a hexagonal torus topology.

	\section{Wrapped triples}
		
		A triple forms a partition which can be used to tile a hexagonal torus when
		tiled using triads of triples. To increase the number of nodes in the
		partition, layers of hexagons may be wrapped around a triple to form a
		`wrapped triple' as in figure~\ref{fig:wrapped-triple}. Wrapped triples
		have the same balanced communications as triples and triads of
		wrapped triples also share translational symmetry with a pointy-topped
		hexagon. Therefore, triads of wrapped triples may be used to tile a
		hexagonal torus topology.

		In SpiNNaker, each board partitions the network into a four-layer wrapped
		triple (figure~\ref{fig:wrapped-triple}) containing forty~eight chips
		(nodes) each, convenient for implementation on a standard-sized
		$220.00\times233.35$~\si{\milli\meter} Eurocard circuit
		board~\cite{ieee11011}.
		
		A triad of boards may be interconnected to form a $12\times12$ hexagonal
		torus as illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:threeboard-apdx}. Six boards may be
		interconnected to form a $12\times24$ or $24\times12$ topology. Nine can
		form a $12\times36$ or $36\times12$ topology. At twelve boards, a `square'
		$24\times24$ topology may be formed, corresponding to half a frame in a
		large SpiNNaker installation. The architectural limit of the SpiNNaker
		architecture combines \num{1200} boards to produce a $240\times240$
		hexagonal torus topology.
